Demo website for the Hogtown Hash House Harriers (https://www.hogtownh3.com/). The site is essentially just an events calendar with a sqlite backend and an admin mode for CRUD functionality. Its main purpose is to demonstrate pure-python full-stack development using the nicegui (https://nicegui.io/) library.
