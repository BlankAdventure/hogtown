Hogtown (aka Toronto) Hash House Harriers (H4) is a Toronto area social group founded in 1987 that meets regularly for events called “hashes”, where participants, called “hashers” work together to find and follow a trail, either running or walking. Typical trails are five to ten kilometers or less, depending on who laid the trail (called the “hare”). Anyone and everyone are welcome to turn up to a hash. Hashing is world-wide and there are hashes in many cities worldwide. A brief history and list of worldwide hashes is here . There are no membership fees. There is typically a fee for the hash collected at the start, to cover the cost of a beer at the end and possibly on trail (at a “beer check”). First-timers pay no fee, and non-drinkers, who are regular participants, pay a much smaller fee to cover just the cost of laying the trail. Trails usually start indoors at a pub or house with a social gathering, and the pack then heads off about 30 minutes after the “start time” to find and follow the trail. Then there is an optional social gathering indoors after the trail with food and drinks.
